        What Is Interview Coder?
      </Heading>
      <Box mb={8}>
        <Text mb={4}>
          Originally developed as a desktop application, Interview Coder was designed to help software engineers during technical interviews. The tool was specifically created to be invisible during screen sharing and technical assessments, allowing users to take screenshots of coding problems without detection. It then utilized AI to analyze these problems and generate solutions in real-time.

        <Text mb={4}>
          Interview Coder gained significant attention after its creator, Chungin &quot;Roy&quot; Lee, a former Columbia University student, publicly demonstrated using the tool during technical interviews with major tech companies. Lee claimed that he successfully secured internship offers from companies including Amazon, Meta, TikTok, and Capital One using the tool.

          The controversy escalated when Lee posted a video of himself using Interview Coder during an Amazon internship interview on YouTube. This public demonstration led to significant backlash, with Amazon attempting to have the video removed and reporting Lee to Columbia University.

          Columbia University subsequently took disciplinary action, initially placing Lee on probation for &quot;facilitation of academic dishonesty.&quot; The situation further deteriorated when Lee published documents from his disciplinary record on social media, which resulted in his suspension from the university.

          <Text mb={2} fontWeight="bold">Controversial Marketing:</Text>
          <Text mb={4} pl={4}>
            The company has embraced a provocative marketing stance, positioning its tools not as educational aids but explicitly as tools to &quot;cheat on everything,&quot; comparing itself to innovations like calculators and spellcheck that were initially considered forms of cheating.

      <Box mb={8}>
        <Text mb={4}>
          The Interview Coder controversy has sparked broader debates about the relevance and effectiveness of traditional technical interview methods, particularly &quot;LeetCode-style&quot; coding challenges. Critics argue these assessments often test memorization of specific algorithms rather than practical programming skills relevant to actual job requirements.

          Some companies have already begun adapting their interview processes in response to these tools:
